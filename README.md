# ðŸš€ NASA Astronomy Picture Of the Day  ðŸš€

This webpage uses NASA's open API of Astronomy Picture of the Day 

## Description

I have created a page that a user can look up the current day's picture or video from NASA's API. There is also a calender that a user can click to see any previous picture of the day.

**Libaries that were used:**
This app was created using React, using the style library of Material-UI and some Reactstrap. Moment was also used to format the date, and React Calendar was used so that a user can select a different date to see another picture or video.
